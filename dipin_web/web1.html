<h2>Client/Server Concepts</h2>
<p id="section1">
The Client-server model is a distributed application structure that partitions task or workload between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters called clients. In the client-server architecture, when the client computer sends a request for data to the server through the internet, the server accepts the requested process and deliver the data packets requested back to the client. Clients do not share any of their resources. Examples of Client-Server Model are Email, World Wide Web, etc.<br><br>

<h2>How the Client-Server Model works ?</h2>
In this article we are going to take a dive into the Client-Server model and have a look at how the Internet works via, web browsers. This article will help us in having a solid foundation of the WEB and help in working with WEB technologies with ease.

Client: When we talk the word Client, it mean to talk of a person or an organization using a particular service. Similarly in the digital world a Client is a computer (Host) i.e. capable of receiving information or using a particular service from the service providers (Servers).
Servers: Similarly, when we talk the word Servers, It mean a person or medium that serves something. Similarly in this digital world a Server is a remote computer which provides information (data) or access to particular services.
So, its basically the Client requesting something and the Server serving it as long as its present in the database.<br><br>

<h2>How the browser interacts with the servers ?</h2>
There are few steps to follow to interacts with the servers a client.
<br>
User enters the URL(Uniform Resource Locator) of the website or file. The Browser then requests the DNS(DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM) Server.
DNS Server lookup for the address of the WEB Server.<br>
DNS Server responds with the IP address of the WEB Server.
Browser sends over an HTTP/HTTPS request to WEB Server’s IP (provided by DNS server).<br>
Server sends over the necessary files of the website.<br>
Browser then renders the files and the website is displayed. This rendering is done with the help of DOM (Document Object Model) interpreter, CSS interpreter and JS Engine collectively known as the JIT or (Just in Time) Compilers.<br>
</p>



<h2>Advantages of Client-Server model:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Centralized system with all data in a single place.</li>
<li>Cost efficient requires less maintenance cost and Data recovery is possible.</li>
<li>The capacity of the Client and Servers can be changed separately.</li>
</ul>
<br><br></p>

<p>
<h2>Disadvantages of Client-Server model:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Clients are prone to viruses, Trojans and worms if present in the Server or uploaded into the Server.</li>
<li>Server are prone to Denial of Service (DOS) attacks.</li>
<li>Data packets may be spoofed or modified during transmission.</li>
<li>Phishing or capturing login credentials or other useful information of the user are common and MITM(Man in the Middle) attacks are common.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>

<h2>Components of Web Application</h2>
<p id="section2">
All web-based database applications have three primary components: A web browser (or client), a web application server, and a database server.<br><br>

Web-based database applications rely on a database server, which provides the data for the application. The database server sometimes also provides business logic in the form of stored procedures. Stored procedures can offer significant performance advantages, especially in a multi-tiered architecture. In addition to database servers, other enterprise information system components include IMS databases, IBM® MQ messages, and CICS® records.<br><br>

The clients handle the presentation logic, which controls the way in which users interact with the application. In some cases, the client validates user-provided input. Web applications sometimes integrate Java™ applets into the client-side logic to improve the presentation layer.<br><br>

<b><u>Applet</u></b>
A Java program that is part of a Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) page. (HTML is the standard method for presenting web data to users.) Applets work with Java-enabled browsers, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer; they are loaded when the HTML page is processed.<br>
Web application servers manage the business logic. The business logic, typically written in Java, supports multitiered applications. The web application server can manage requests from a variety of remote clients. The web application layer might include JavaServer Pages (JSP) files, Java servlets, Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) components, or web services.<br><br>

<b><u>JSP</u></b>
A technology that provides a consistent way to extend web server functionality and create dynamic web content. The web applications that you develop with JSP technology are server and platform independent.<br><br>
<u><b>Servlet</u></b>
A Java program that responds to client requests and generates responses dynamically.<br><br>
<u><b>EJB</u></b>
A component architecture for building distributed applications with the Java programming model. Server transactional components are reusable and provide portability across application servers.<br><br>
<u><b>Web services</u></b>
Self-contained, modular applications that provide an interface between the provider and the consumer of application resources. You can read more about web services later in this information.<br><br>

<h2>Types of Web Content</h2>
<p id=section3">
Most popular types of content
The best websites create a mix of different content types to keep their readers interested. While there are hundreds of different types of web content, these 50 in-particular are our favorite types of digital content.<br><br>


<b>1. Articles</b><br><br>
This type of web content develops an idea and incorporates interviews, quotes, and data to support the article’s hypothesis. Articles are usually long-form content, between 1,000 and 3,000 words.
<br>
<b>2. Blog posts</b><br><br>
Blog posts typically range between 500 and 750 words, focusing on a variety of topics. Some of these topics can include news in the industry, bios of industry leaders, reviews of new products, and more.
<br>

<b>3. Surveys</b><br><br>
Adding surveys to your content arsenal can gauge your readers’ interest and to increase reader engagement with your brand. Surveys are also fun for the reader and is one of the more interactive content types.
<br>
<b>4. Quizzes</b><br><br>
Quizzes are another way to engage your reader, by having a question on one page and the answer on the next, which adds extra potential for ad revenue and click-throughs.
<br>
<b>5. Photos</b><br><br>
Images help make your content more visually appealing, and contributes to the overall user experience. Additionally, optimizing your photos with alt-text and captions to your images can even help with your rankings on Google Images.
<br>
<b>6. Videos</b><br><br>
Using videos is a great way to diversify your content and add visual interest to your pages. These can be videos you take yourself or videos from sources like YouTube or Vimeo. (Just make sure to give credit where credit is due.)
<br>
<b>7. Case studies</b><br><br>
Case studies outline how a particular individual or company used a product or service. Seeing a real person use your product can help potential buyers see themselves using it and, thus, encouragement to purchase from you.

<h2>Overview of HTTP - HTTP Request – Response</h2>
<p id="section4">
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. This is the foundation for data communication for the World Wide Web (i.e. internet) since 1990. HTTP is a generic and stateless protocol which can be used for other purposes as well using extensions of its request methods, error codes, and headers.<br><br>

Basically, HTTP is a TCP/IP based communication protocol, that is used to deliver data (HTML files, image files, query results, etc.) on the World Wide Web. The default port is TCP 80, but other ports can be used as well. It provides a standardized way for computers to communicate with each other. HTTP specification specifies how clients' request data will be constructed and sent to the server, and how the servers respond to these requests.<br><br>

<b><u>Basic Features</b></u>
There are three basic features that make HTTP a simple but powerful protocol:
<ul>
<li>HTTP is connectionless: The HTTP client, i.e., a browser initiates an HTTP request and after a request is made, the client waits for the response. The server processes the request and sends a response back after which client disconnect the connection. So client and server knows about each other during current request and response only. Further requests are made on new connection like client and server are new to each other.</li><br>
</ul>

HTTP is media independent: It means, any type of data can be sent by HTTP as long as both the client and the server know how to handle the data content. It is required for the client as well as the server to specify the content type using appropriate MIME-type.

HTTP is stateless: As mentioned above, HTTP is connectionless and it is a direct result of HTTP being a stateless protocol. The server and client are aware of each other only during a current request. Afterwards, both of them forget about each other. Due to this nature of the protocol, neither the client nor the browser can retain information between different requests across the web pages.

HTTP/1.0 uses a new connection for each request/response exchange, where as HTTP/1.1 connection may be used for one or more request/response exchanges.
Basic Architecture
The following diagram shows a very basic architecture of a web application and depicts where HTTP sits:

HTTP Architecture
The HTTP protocol is a request/response protocol based on the client/server based architecture where web browsers, robots and search engines, etc. act like HTTP clients, and the Web server acts as a server.

Client
The HTTP client sends a request to the server in the form of a request method, URI, and protocol version, followed by a MIME-like message containing request modifiers, client information, and possible body content over a TCP/IP connection.

Server
The HTTP server responds with a status line, including the message's protocol version and a success or error code, followed by a MIME-like message containing server information, entity meta information, and possible entity-body content.
