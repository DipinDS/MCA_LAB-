<h2><b>Client/Server concepts</h2></b>
The web is based on the client-server model, where a client (such as a web browser) sends requests to a server, which responds with data that the client can display to the user

. The client and server communicate over a network using protocols such as HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

<h2><b>Components of Web Application</h2></b>
All web-based database applications have three primary components: a web browser (or client), a web application server, and a database server

. A typical web server today contains four elements in addition to the physical hardware: the operating system, web server, a database, and a scripting language

<h2></b>Types of Web Content</h2></b>
Web content can be static or dynamic. Static content is fixed and does not change unless the web developer manually updates it. Dynamic content, on the other hand, is generated by the server in response to user requests and can change based on user input or other factors
<br><br>
<h2><b>Overview of HTTP - HTTP request â€“ response</h2></b>
<p>
Web browsers communicate with web servers using the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 
1
. When a user clicks a link or submits a form, the browser sends an HTTP request to the server, which includes a URL identifying the target server and resource
1
5
. The server responds with an HTTP response, which includes the requested data

.</p>
<h2><b>Generation of dynamic web pages</h2></b>
Dynamic web pages are generated by the server in response to user requests
1
5
. The server-side code handles requests and responses in similar ways, and developers need to write code that can handle these requests and generate appropriate responses

.
Application Servers
An application server is a server that provides the infrastructure for running web applications
2
. It typically includes a web server, a database server, and a scripting language
3
.
Web Security
Web security is a critical concern for web developers. There are many potential vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) 
5
. Developers need to take steps to secure their web applications, such as validating user input, using secure communication protocols (such as HTTPS), and implementing access controls
